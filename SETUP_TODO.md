# Planet Game Web Port - External Setup TODO

## Database/Hosting Setup (Optional Advanced Features)

### 1. Database Backend (for Cross-Device Saves)
**If you want player saves to sync across devices:**
- Set up a simple backend server (Node.js + Express recommended)
- Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for data storage
- Implement REST API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/save-player-data` - Save player progress
  - `GET /api/load-player-data/:playerId` - Load player progress
  - `POST /api/save-achievements` - Save achievements
  - `GET /api/achievements/:playerId` - Load achievements

### 2. Web Hosting Setup
**For public deployment:**
- **Static Hosting (Recommended):** GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages
- **Requirements:** Just upload the `/web` folder contents
- **Domain Setup:** Point your domain to the hosting service
- **HTTPS:** Ensure HTTPS is enabled (required for IndexedDB to work reliably)

### 3. Progressive Web App (PWA) Setup
**To make it installable like a native app:**
- Create `manifest.json` with app metadata
- Add service worker for offline functionality
- Add app icons (various sizes: 192x192, 512x512, etc.)

### 4. Analytics Setup (Optional)
**To track player engagement:**
- Google Analytics 4 integration
- Track game starts, completions, difficulty preferences
- Monitor achievement completion rates

## Current Status: ✅ READY TO PLAY

**The game currently works with:**
- ✅ Local persistent storage (IndexedDB) - survives cookie clearing
- ✅ Fallback to localStorage if IndexedDB fails
- ✅ Automatic data migration from old localStorage saves
- ✅ Full offline functionality
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design

## Quick Start (No External Setup Required)

1. **Local Testing:**
   ```bash
   cd "Planet Game/web"
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Visit http://localhost:8000/mainmenu.html
   ```

2. **Simple Deployment:**
   - Upload entire `/web` folder to any static hosting service
   - No server-side code required
   - Game works immediately

## Advanced Features That Don't Require External Setup

- **Persistent Saves:** Already implemented with IndexedDB
- **Achievement System:** Already ported from Java version
- **Settings Persistence:** Already working locally
- **Mobile Support:** Already responsive
- **Offline Play:** Works without internet after initial load

## Notes

- The current implementation is production-ready for most use cases
- External database is only needed for cross-device synchronization
- All core functionality works purely client-side
- Game saves persist even if user clears cookies (uses IndexedDB)
